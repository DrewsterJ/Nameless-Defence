## Before you start:
### - Explore: Read the documentation, browse the code, and grasp the project's purpose.

## Details:
- All commits and branch merges should have a clear explanation of your changes. Please reference related issues and discussion if needed.
- All code should be well-formatted and documented.
----------------
## Issues:
- It's recommended to provide a digital drawing for issues you plan to implement that have the label `ui`. Upload them as comments on the corresponding issue.
- If you create a new issue and it relies on another issue being completed, add the issue that must be completed as a subtask of the issue you created.

## Branches
- All branches should be based off one or more issues and well-scoped. If any branch you create goes out of scope, you should merge that branch into main and create a new branch with a broader scope. It is recommended that you create a branch and branch off of created branches to maintain good scopes.
- All branch merges should squash commits.
